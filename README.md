This a Data science project done by AKWA  ETIM INYANG-ITO.

With the use of creditcard dataset, I built a model to be able to predict if a card transaction is either fraudulent or legitimate. 

i used the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify flowers into different species using their sepal and petal measurement.
